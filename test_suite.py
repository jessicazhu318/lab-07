   # Blink LED 5x w/ on/off intervals of 500ms
   
   # For ~5sec, read output of Grove light sensor w/ intervals of 100ms
   #and print raw value along w/ text "bright" or "dark" (determine threshold
   #through experimentation)
   
   # Blink LED 4x w/ on/off intervals of 200ms
   
   # For ~5sec, read output of Grove sound sensor w/ intervals of 100ms
   #and print raw value, if sensor is tapped (ie. sound magnitude exceeds
   #threshold decided from experiment), LED should turn on for 100ms
